Hello, 

I am a Graduate Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto working in the area of fuel cells and renewable energy materials. Specifically, i am developing a deep neural network architecture that is able to identify and characterize the microstructure of the gas diffusion layer in a Hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell. 

On occasion i work on personal projects involving my interests; fluid mechanics, heat transfer, environment, education, and data. 

thanks for reading, 

Taylr
